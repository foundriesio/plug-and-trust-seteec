        e.g. Files at ``sss/src/user/crypto`` have low level AES/CMAC primitives.
        The files at ``sss/src/user`` use those primitives.
        This becomes an example for users with their own AES Implementation
        This then becomes integration without mbedTLS/OpenSSL for SCP03 / AESKey.

        .. note:: ECKey abstraction is not implemented/available yet.

    ``-DHostCrypto=None``: NO Host Crypto
        Note, this is unsecure and only provided for experimentation
